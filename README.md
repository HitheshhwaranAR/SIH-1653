## Problem Title
Smart Home Energy Management System
## Problem Description
The Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) is designed to help homeowners track and control their energy consumption efficiently. It integrates various IoT-enabled devices in a home to provide real-time insights into energy usage, suggest energy-saving practices, and allow users to remotely control devices to optimize energy use. By doing so, it aims to reduce the carbon footprint, lower electricity bills, and promote sustainable living.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Energy Department, Ministry of Power

## Idea
1.Energy Usage Monitoring
 * Real-time monitoring of energy consumption for all major appliances in the home.
 * Integration with smart meters to track the overall energy usage and provide detailed reports on daily, weekly, and monthly consumption.
 * Alerts for unusual spikes in energy usage to help users detect inefficiencies or faulty appliances.

2.Remote Control of Appliances
 * Allow users to control smart devices (such as lights, HVAC, refrigerators, etc.) remotely through a mobile app or web platform.
 * Schedule appliances to turn on or off at specific times (e.g., heating during cold hours, turning off lights when not needed).

3.Energy Efficiency Analytics
 * Provide users with insights into their energy consumption habits and compare them with similar homes.
 * Show progress toward reducing carbon footprint with graphs and statistics over time.

4.Smart Device Recommendations
 * Suggest energy-efficient devices (smart lights, thermostats, etc.) based on the user’s home energy usage patterns.
 * Provide a marketplace for energy-saving products with integration for purchase directly through the platform.

## Use Cases
1.Real-time Energy Monitoring
  * Homeowners can view live data on their energy consumption for each appliance, enabling them to take immediate action to reduce consumption.

2.Device Scheduling and Automation
  * Users can automate their home devices based on time or specific energy conditions (e.g., "turn off lights when no motion is detected").

3.Energy Usage Insights and Reports
  * Users receive weekly/monthly energy reports showing their consumption, energy cost, and carbon footprint.

4.Smart Recommendations
  * Based on the user’s usage pattern, the system suggests optimizing the use of appliances (e.g., recommending switching to energy-efficient bulbs or adjusting thermostat settings).

5.Notification and Alerts
  * Users receive notifications when energy consumption exceeds set thresholds or when an appliance is malfunctioning or overconsuming power.

## Technology Stack
1.Frontend
2.Backend
3.Database
4.Cloud Infrastructure
5.IoT Communication Protocols
6.Data Analytics and Machine Learning
## Dependencies
Budget (Rs. 50,000)
1.Development Costs
 * Developer salaries for mobile app and backend development.
 * Smart home devices (smart meters, thermostats, etc.).
 * Cloud services and API usage (AWS, Firebase, etc.).

2.Marketing & Awareness
 * Social media campaigns to promote the app and raise awareness about energy conservation.
